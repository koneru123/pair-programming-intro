## Introduction to Pair Programming

At Hack Reactor, we pair program all the time! It's a great way to reduce bugs, improve communication skills, and increase understanding. Today, you'll get your first experience working as a pair to solve a problem. It can be trickier than expected, so try to be thoughtful and kind.

## Bare Minimum Requirements

Bare minimum requirements are just that - the work that will be absolutely crucial that you complete and understand. If you do not complete bare minimum requirements within the time frame allotted for the activity, please reach out to staff to let us know and to formulate a plan for getting back on track.

### Setup
- [ ] If you are the first person listed in your pair, create a video link that you and your pair can use (and so staff can drop by!).
- [ ] If your pair doesn't show up soon, ping them on slack.
- [ ] Decide who will be driver first, and who will be navigator.

### Solving the problem
- [ ] Fork and Clone `intro-pair-programming` 
- [ ] Go through the problem solving process together, with the navigator leading and the driver typing.
- [ ] Actually solve the problem! When you have passed all of the tests you will then...
- [ ] Switch driver and navigator roles, and repeat for the next problem
